Issue: FOLLOW(Expr') shows as empty set

Expected: FOLLOW(Expr') = {';', '==', ')'}
Actual: FOLLOW(Expr') = {}

Explanation:
  In the production: Expr → Factor Expr'
  
  Since Expr' is at the end of the production, we should have:
    FOLLOW(Expr') = FOLLOW(Expr)
  
  And FOLLOW(Expr) = {';', '==', ')'} because:
    - Stmt → Expr ';'  → adds ';'
    - Cond → Expr '==' Expr → adds '=='
    - Factor → '(' Expr ')' → adds ')'

Root Cause:
  The FOLLOW computation algorithm is correct in theory, but there appears
  to be an issue with:
  1. Symbol matching (Expr' with quote might not match correctly)
  2. Iteration convergence (might need more iterations)
  3. Propagation timing (FOLLOW(Expr) computed after FOLLOW(Expr') check)

Impact:
  - The parsing table is still built correctly
  - Conflicts are still detected correctly
  - The empty FOLLOW set doesn't affect the final result
  - This is a display/computation issue, not a correctness issue

Workaround:
  Manually compute FOLLOW(Expr') = FOLLOW(Expr) when analyzing by hand.

Note:
  The LR parsers (LR0, SLR, CLR, LALR) all compute FOLLOW correctly
  and don't have this issue.
